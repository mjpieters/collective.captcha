Captchas

Generation
----------

To use the captcha view, simply look up the view using the component architecture.

Here, we'll just import the view directly to demonstrate it's use:

  >>> from collective.captcha.browser.captcha import Captcha, COOKIE_ID
  >>> request = DummyRequest()
  >>> context = DummyContext()
  >>> view = Captcha(context, request)

We can now use the view to generate an image tag, and a audio_url:

  >>> view.image_tag()
  '<img src="dummyurl/@@captcha/image" />'
  >>> view.audio_url()
  'dummyurl/@@captcha/audio'

The request now holds the state in a cookie:

  >>> COOKIE_ID in request.cookies
  True
  
Verification
------------

With that state, we can verify that the user has given us the correct word. The view
doesn't actually give us the word, but we can replay an existing session for the test:

  >>> request2 = DummyRequest()
  >>> request2.setCookie(COOKIE_ID, '6552fec8867ee2a85a44784dda007e49efcf50ef')
  >>> view = Captcha(context, request2)

The verify method, then, tells you if the user entered the correct word:

  >>> view.verify('@SMAJG8')
  True
  
Note that the view immediately invalidates the cookie by expiring it:

  >>> COOKIE_ID in request2.expiredcookies
  True
  
The verify method works case-insensitively:

  >>> view.verify('@SmAjG8')
  True
  
Verification will fail for both incorrect input and a missing cookie:

  >>> view.verify('incorrect')
  False
  >>> del request2.cookies[COOKIE_ID]
  >>> view.verify('2NHL/VT')
  False

Displaying
----------

The point of course is that the end-user gets to view the captcha image or listen to the 
audio file:

  >>> request = DummyRequest()
  >>> request.setCookie(COOKIE_ID, '6552fec8867ee2a85a44784dda007e49efcf50ef')
  >>> view = Captcha(context, request)

  >>> image = view.image()
  >>> image.startswith('\x89PNG')
  True
  >>> request.headers['content-type']
  'image/png'

  >>> audio = view.audio()
  >>> audio.startswith('RIFF')
  True
  >>> request.headers['content-type']
  'audio/wav'
