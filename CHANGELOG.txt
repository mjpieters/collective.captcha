collective.captcha changes
--------------------------

1.2 (svn/unreleased)
--------------------

- Add a captcha field and widget for zope.formlib.

- Reduced the characters used to generate the captcha to uppercase letters and
  numbers only; user testing showed that even humans had trouble solving the
  captchas.

1.1 (2007-11-21)
----------------

- Delete the captcha cookie from the response if one is present to
  prevent premature expiration. This would happen when creating a
  new captcha after verification (because verification failed or
  the form would have to be redisplayed for other reasons). Thanks to
  David Glick for pointing this out.

1.0 (2007-11-19)
----------------

- Initial release
