1.4 (2008-05-02)
----------------

- Switched to using plone.keyring to provide the secret.

1.3 (2008-02-22)
----------------

- SkimpyGimpy now does have an egg, thanks to Reed O'Brien! Updated 
  installation instructions and setup.py.

- Update test to reflect reduced character set used.

1.2 (2007-12-13)
----------------

- Add a captcha field and widget for zope.formlib.

- Reduced the characters used to generate the captcha to uppercase letters and
  numbers only; user testing showed that even humans had trouble solving the
  captchas.

1.1 (2007-11-21)
----------------

- Delete the captcha cookie from the response if one is present to
  prevent premature expiration. This would happen when creating a
  new captcha after verification (because verification failed or
  the form would have to be redisplayed for other reasons). Thanks to
  David Glick for pointing this out.

1.0 (2007-11-19)
----------------

- Initial release
